# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 21, 2017 7:35AM

**Today's Progress**: Finished the HTML and CSS part of the freeCodeCamp Front-End certification

**Thoughts:** This challenge actually made me realized how I missed working with pure HTML and CSS. It was basic for me, but tomorrow I plan on working with Bootsrap, which is something I don't really know anything about so it's bound to be fun! I plan on getting to the projects on the weekend.

**Link to work:** Not yet!
